# CuratedCode

A simple and highly random corner of the internet.

I write about anything that pops into my head during the week and eventually becomes a project during the weekend (or vice-versa).

Built on [Jekyll](http//jekyllrb.com) - because its awesome.


## Topics I dig

- Experiments with Arduino
- Ruby on Rails
- JavaScript Hacking & Libs
