## Why I am getting into Security Research
Plain and Simple: Curiosity. 

I was trying to come up with some savvy introduction for my research. However, two days later and a bunch of select all + deletes later I had nothing to put here except the definition above. As I sit here drinking a beer, I am thinking about Steve Jobs and his famous words:

> Stay hungry, <br /> Stay foolish.

This is what its all about. He wasnt the only smart man to provide this advice either. Here is another one from Walt Disney, a man of infinite creativity who built an empire:

> We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.

So with that said. I begin with a German beer by my side and the world wide web and some of the world's best security experts to guide me on my journey. Cheers.

## Questions to answer. <small>Not in any order</small>

- How do things work. I may know a good chunk but do I REALLY know?
- Why do we use these methods?
- When should we use this vs that?
- How are these all interconnected, if at all.
- What is the best approach (or most desirable) to mitigate risk in scenarios A,B,C...X?
- Who created these and to fill what need?
- Where is the industry going? This may lack a definite answer so will be based on standards.
- How do I put to use the things I have learned?
- Can I become knowledgeable enough to contribute to open security projects? - I should probably rephrase this to am I *confident* enough to contribute to a project? IF (!confident) {do more research}.

I will start from the ground up for good practice and reinforcement of concepts.
