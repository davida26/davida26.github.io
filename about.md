Curated Code is my latest project designed to centralize information. Through this [Jekyll] (https://jekyllrb.com/) powered site, I intend to record my experiments, discoveries and random ramblings about the web and technology. The resource is primarily built for me but if your search query landed you here then more power to you. I hope it helps readers like you dig deeper into the web and innovate some projects of your own. 

Given the present page you are at, you probably want to know a little more about me and if you don't well read on because why not - maybe you will get a laugh out of it. So without any further ado, here is my story.... 


## The Early Years

These were probably the best years for me. I like to think these are everyone's best years that we all take for granted. For example, the only burning feel of anxiety that I had was who was going to change my shitty diaper and feed me my next bottle. Furthermore, everything was comped under my parents tab and the existence of currency was foreign to me. Life was good!

Anyway, since I was young, I liked the idea of practicing things over and over again until I had achieved an acceptable level of mastery. Have I mentioned I was a baby genius? 

Take for example this scenario: my first goal in life was making myself more mobile. So I needed to master crawling. As soon as I figured that out, I landed my first Pamper's Commercial. Not only did this first gig land me more girlfriends than I could handle, it also got me a years supply of diapers. #genius


## The Tech Start

Around my 10th birthday, I got into the tech scene, primarily due to the fact my father had saved up enough to buy the first family computer - *some of you younger readers may not understand how expensive or what a floppy drive pc was*. So back tot he story, from day one of setting it up to the day we finally got AOL and the beautiful dial-up noise started - I could not get enough of it. 

I spent a significant amount of time learning about the components a traditional computer had. When that no longer satisfied my interest, I moved to opening up everything I could get my hands on. This included old T.V's, radios, phones, etc. This was also the first time I learned that a capacitor holds a charge. Ouch. 


## The Akward Years

Everyone goes through them, right? Hey, at least the picture are funny to look at. These were the years of plain awkward me trying to fit in the world. These were the years when I was called a "nerd" and I took it as an insult - *if only I could tell my 13 year old self then how much of a compliment that is now*.

In a nutshell: these were the years where I was pretending to be a mad scientist by putting spiders in different solutions, attempting to play sports but not really excelling at any of them, leaching off my neighbors wifi to learn more web stuff, waking up early to watch the Nature Nut guy on the Discovery Channel, and, well....I think you get the idea here :)

## ET Found Home

Around age 15 is where I really got my start in this world. [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) - I am forever thankful for putting out the first resource I used to learn about the web. Simple web tutorials that took me step by step through HTML, CSS, and JavaScripts basics.

Who knew, at the time, that learning about the web would lead me to where I am today. What got me hooked was the idea of seeing my code transform into a webpage that anyone in the world could see.  Sound familiar MySpace peeps? #tbt

These web years were also the years that my awkward self changed. I was perfectly fine with being a nerd now and it even paid well. What can I say? The demand for homework "assistance" to the cool kids was high.

These were also the years that in addition to learning about web development, I landed a part-time job at a dance studio. This gave me the edge I needed for the real world. I needed to get out of my shell and this was the perfect way to do it. It was constant social interaction with clients, getting over the fear of making phone calls and towards the end - teaching salsa, tango, foxtrot and more.

Yep, I mastered the art to dancing ballroom and gained a greater appreciation of cultural influences that shape the world. For you see, music (or the US) would not be where it is at today if various cultures had not contibuted their own flavor. 

Also the dance studio had more women than men, I was in heaven. Reminds you of the baby genius story above, doesn't it?


## The SE Years

By the time I got to college, I clearly knew what I wanted to do. I loved computers, coding and the web. It was only natural for me to declare my major as Software Engineering (SE). College was an experience on its own, as many of us would agree. My academic achievements combined with my newly found social skills did well.

College was a blast:

- I got to experiment with C++
- Learned about Java and how I could use it for the web
- I found out that I really did not need coffee #hotChocolateForLife
- Got even fancier with more web technologies and scripting languages
- Started setting up servers #LinuxFTW
- Landed a few web developer roles
- Blew up a couple Databases
- Had a few beers too many (RIP Freshman Year)

and as many of you can agree, the four best years of my life flew by. And yes, these "best years" were even better than my Pamper Commercial "best years". This went to show that maybe responsibilities and hard work just meant more instense "play" time.

## Today

Today I am completing my Masters and work as a Full Stack Engineer at IWH, the parent company behind seven popular e-commerce websites. I also do consulting on occassion because I enjoy transforming projects in challenging markets and making them successful. 

Outside of the tech world: I love kayaking, rock climbing, hiking and driving my Jeep through puddles of water. I also have been blessed the past few years to live right on the beach. So every morning / night, I clear my head by taking a nice walk 1.5 mile walk down the beach with my dog, Ocean.
