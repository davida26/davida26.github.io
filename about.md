So you have an interest in the stuff I do or want to be a little creepy ;)

Whatever the case may be - here is a little snippet to who I am.

You should also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-aviles/89/19a/796) for:

- Professional Inquiries
- Random Connections in the Field
- or just to say hello, I do respond (unless you're a recruiter and then you really need to catch my eye) 

and so without further ado, my story...


## The Early Years

These were probably the best years for me. I like to think these are everyone's best years we take for granted.

Since I was young, I liked the idea practicing things over and over again until I had achieved an acceptable level of mastery.

So the first to-do item I mastered was crawling. Now of course I don't remember much of this time but what I do know is my mastery landed me in a Pampers Commercial. Wherever my mother called, I went (and even where she did not). Long story short this first gig got me a years supply of diapers #win

Fast forward a few years and I was landing more girlfriends than I could handle - *wish that had been the case in highschool*. 

I also had everything comped and the existance of currency was foreign to me. Life was good.


## The Tech Start

Around my 10th birthday, I got into the tech scene. Primarily due to the fact my father had saved up enough to buy the first family computer. From day one of setting it up to the day we finally got AOL and the beautiful dial-up noise started, I could not get enough of it. 

I spent a significant amount of time learning about the components a traditional computer had. When that no longer satisfied my interest, I moved to opening up everything I could get my hands on. This included old tvs, radios, phones, etc. This was also the first time I learned that a capacitor holds a charge. Ouch. Of course this meant I spent a lot of time indoors experiment and so the next set of years started.


## The Akward Years

Not much to see here. Just plain awkward me trying to fit in the world. The years when I was called a "nerd" and I took it as an insult - *if only I could tell my 13 year old self how much of a compliment that is*.

In a nutshell: these were the years where I was pretending to be a mad scientist by putting spiders in different solutions, attempting to play sports but not really excelling at any of them, leaching off my neighbors wifi to learn more web stuff, waking up early to watch the Nature Nut guy on the Discovery Channel and well....I think you get the idea here :)

## The Change Years

Around 15, is where I really got my start in this world. [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) - I am forever thankful for putting out the first resource I used to learn about the web.

Who knew at the time that learning about HTML and CSS would lead me to where I am today. What got me hooked was the idea of seeing my code transform into a webpage that anyone in the world could see.  

The web years were also the years that my awkward self changed. I was perfectly fine with being a nerd now and it even paid well. What can I say? The demand for homework "assistance" to the cool kids was high.

These were also the years that in addition to learning about web development, I landed a part-time at a dance studio. This gave me the edge I needed for the real world. I needed to get out of my shell and this was the perfect way to do it. It was constant social interaction with clients, making phone calls (used to get nervous talking on the phone) and towards the end - teaching salsa, tango, foxtrot and more.

Yep, I learned to dance. The dance studio had more women than men, I was in heaven.

## The SE Years

By the time I got to college, I knew what I wanted to do. I loved computers, coding and the web. It was only natural for me to declare my major as Software Engineering (SE). College was an experience on its own as many of us would agree. My academic achievements combined with my newly found social skills did well. College was a blast:
- I got to experiment with C++
- Learned about Java and how I could use it for the web
- Got even fancier with web technologies
- Setup a few servers
- Landed a few web developer roles

and 4 of the best years of my life flew by.

## Today

Today I am finalizing my Masters and work as a Full Stack Engineer @ IWH, the parent company behind seven popular e-commerce websites. I also do consulting on ocassion because I enjoy transforming projects in challenging markets and making them successful. 

Much like a leaf, I go with the flow. And much like a leaf, I like spending time outdoors and traveling.
